# TODO

Tasks required to reach parity with JS SDK at spec v0.4.2:

 - [ ] Handle "null condition" `evalCondition` test cases.
 - [ ] Implement new hashing algorithm and tests.
 - [ ] Implement ranges and relevant `feature` and `run` tests.
 - [ ] Add meta information, key and name everywhere they're needed
       (plus `feature` tests).
 - [ ] Implement filters (and corresponding tests).
 - [ ] Fix remaining spec tests.
 - [ ] Implement feature usage callback.
 - [ ] Implement feature loading, repositories and caching.
 - [ ] Update initialization API to make use of automatic feature
       loading.
 - [ ] Encrypted features and experiments (and tests).
